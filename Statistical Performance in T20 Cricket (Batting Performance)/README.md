## 📂 Dataset Summary

The dataset consists of **career-level T20 batting statistics** of international cricketers, including:

- Runs, strike rate, batting average  
- Balls faced, innings, matches  
- Boundaries (fours & sixes)  
- Duck outs, not-outs, dismissal status  
- Career span and longevity indicators

## 📊 Key Insights from Visual Analysis

### 1️⃣ Structural Inequality in T20 Batting  
Run distributions are extremely right-skewed, with a small elite group dominating career runs. Large mean–median gaps show averages overstate typical performance.  
📌 **Insight:** T20 batting success follows inequality patterns similar to income or productivity distributions.

### 2️⃣ Strike Rate Stability Across Players  
Strike rate exhibits a compact interquartile range (~100–120), with very few extreme outliers.  
📌 **Insight:** Scoring efficiency converges at the professional level.

### 3️⃣ Batting Average Is Rare and Volatile  
Batting averages show strong skew and dispersion, with very few players sustaining averages above 40–50.  
📌 **Insight:** Consistency is statistically rarer and more fragile than strike-rate efficiency.

### 4️⃣ Opportunity Dominates Run Accumulation  
Runs vs balls faced, innings, and matches show near-linear relationships, especially for balls faced and innings.  
📌 **Insight:** Career runs depend more on opportunity than per-ball efficiency.

### 5️⃣ Strike Rate Affects Speed, Not Volume  
Runs vs strike rate plots show high dispersion and weak-to-moderate trends.  
📌 **Insight:** Strike rate controls scoring speed, not long-term run totals.

### 6️⃣ Longevity Amplifies Performance  
Runs increase steadily with matches and innings; earlier debut eras dominate cumulative runs due to longer careers.  
📌 **Insight:** Longevity widens performance gaps.

### 7️⃣ Boundary Scoring Drives Runs  
Runs vs total boundaries show an almost perfectly linear relationship.  
📌 **Insight:** T20 scoring is fundamentally boundary-driven.

### 8️⃣ Fours vs Sixes  
Fours are frequent and stable; sixes are rarer and separate elite batters.  
📌 **Insight:** Fours provide consistency; sixes create separation.

### 9️⃣ Power Hitting Increases Variability  
Dismissed innings show wider strike-rate spreads and extreme values.  
📌 **Insight:** Aggression introduces a measurable risk–reward trade-off.

### 🔟 Not-Outs Have Structural Impact  
Not-out innings show higher upper run extremes and increase with career length.  
📌 **Insight:** Not-outs inflate averages and enable extreme scores.

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Duck Outs Are Rare but Costly  
Duck distributions are skewed toward zero, but repeated ducks suppress averages and efficiency.  
📌 **Insight:** Avoiding early dismissal is a key differentiator.

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Era Effects Are Visible  
Modern players show higher strike rates, while earlier eras dominate cumulative runs.  
📌 **Insight:** T20 cricket has structurally evolved toward aggression.

## 🧪 Hypothesis Testing & Statistical Inference

Formal hypothesis testing was conducted to statistically validate patterns observed during exploratory data analysis. Appropriate parametric and non-parametric tests were applied based on data characteristics.

### 📊 Summary of Hypothesis Test Results

| Research Question | Statistical Test | Key Result | Conclusion |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|------------|
| Does strike rate differ between high-run and low-run scorers? | Independent two-sample *t*-test | *t* = 18.7129, *p* < 0.001 | High-run scorers have significantly higher strike rates |
| Is strike rate correlated with total runs scored? | Pearson correlation | *p* < 0.001 | Strike rate is significantly associated with total runs |
| Is the number of balls faced correlated with total runs? | Spearman correlation | ρ = 0.9837, *p* < 0.001 | Balls faced is the strongest predictor of runs |
| Do high strike-rate players face a different number of balls? | Welch’s *t*-test | *t* = 17.4738, *p* < 0.001 | Aggressive batters face a statistically different number of balls |
| Is highest score different between high- and low-average batters? | Mann–Whitney U | U = 961,259, *p* < 0.001 | High-average batters achieve higher peak scores |
| Is innings played correlated with total runs? | Spearman correlation | ρ = 0.8980, *p* < 0.001 | Innings played strongly predicts run accumulation |
| Does run-scoring consistency differ by batting average? | Levene’s test | 281.38, *p* < 0.001 | Run variability differs across average groups |
| Do six-heavy batters have different strike rates? | Welch’s *t*-test | *t* = 35.8063, *p* < 0.001 | Six-heavy batters sustain higher strike rates |

## 🧠 Final Takeaway

**T20 batting success is multi-dimensional.**  
It emerges from the interaction of:

- Opportunity (balls faced, innings, career length)  
- Boundary-heavy scoring  
- Controlled aggression  
- Avoidance of early dismissals  
- Longevity and adaptability  

Efficiency metrics influence scoring behavior, but **long-term dominance is driven by volume and consistency**, not strike rate alone.

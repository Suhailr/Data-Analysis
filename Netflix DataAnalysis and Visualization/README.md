# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization #

## 📌 Project Overview ##

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis and visualization of Netflix movie data using Python.
The aim is to extract meaningful business insights by answering key analytical questions and presenting findings through clear, well-structured visualizations.

The project follows a real-world Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) workflow, making it suitable for data analyst internships and entry-level roles, including Netflix.

## 🎯 Objectives of the Project ##

Perform structured data cleaning and preprocessing

Identify trends related to popularity, ratings, genres, votes, and release years

Demonstrate data storytelling and analytical thinking

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used ##

Python

Pandas – data manipulation & cleaning

Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization

Jupyter Notebook (PyCharm)

Git & GitHub

## 📂 Dataset Description ##

The dataset contains Netflix movie information with the following columns:

Title – Movie name

Release_Date – Year of release

Genre – Movie genre

Popularity – Popularity score

Vote_Count – Number of user votes

Vote_Average – Average user rating

Each movie may appear multiple times due to multiple genres, allowing genre-wise analysis.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation ##

The following steps were performed before analysis:

Removed missing and inconsistent values

Standardized column formats

Ensured correct data types

Handled duplicate movie-genre records

Prepared data for visualization-ready analysis


## 📈 Key Insights Summary ##

• Action & Adventure genres dominate Netflix’s popular content  

• Movies generate higher user engagement compared to TV Shows  

• Higher popularity strongly correlates with increased vote counts  

• Netflix has consistently expanded content production over the years  

• Average ratings remain stable, reflecting maintained content quality  

• Genre-wise analysis highlights clear audience preference patterns  

• Data visualization enhances clarity and business decision-making


## 🚀 Why This Project Stands Out ##

✔ Industry-style EDA structure
✔ Clear analytical questions
✔ Multiple visualizations per insight
✔ Clean, readable, recruiter-friendly notebook
✔ Demonstrates real-world data analytics workflow

### 🎯 Goal: Boost February Sales with High-Margin Electronics

- Identify top male customers aged 46–63  
- Launch a “Smart Tech Bundle” campaign: smartwatch + charger + case  
- Offer tiered discounts: Buy 2, get 10% off; Buy 3, get 15% off  
- Send personalized SMS offers to high spenders

**Why it works:**  
February has the highest Electronics quantity per transaction. Older males favor high-ticket items. Bundling lifts revenue without increasing acquisition costs.



### 🧥 Goal: Lift September Revenue Despite Low Margins

- Bundle popular Clothing items (jackets, tops) with Beauty accessories  
- Promote “Back-to-Style” kits via email and Instagram  
- Target female customers aged 34–46 with curated sets  
- Offer free shipping for bundles over $100

**Why it works:**  
September has high Clothing volume but low revenue. Bundling with Beauty increases average transaction value. Targeting high-revenue segments improves campaign ROI.



### 📦 Goal: Prepare Inventory for May and October Peaks

- Analyze top-selling Electronics and Clothing SKUs from previous May and October  
- Increase stock 2–3 weeks ahead of each peak  
- Schedule loyalty emails with early access offers  
- Use dashboards to monitor age-gender-product trends in real time

**Why it works:**  
May and October are revenue peak months. Early access drives urgency and repeat purchases. Inventory alignment reduces stockouts and overstocking.
